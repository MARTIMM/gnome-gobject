=TITLE Gnome::GObject::Object

=SUBTITLE GObject â€” The base object type

=head1 Synopsis

Top level class of almost all classes in the GTK, GDK and Glib libraries.

This object is almost never used directly. Most of the classes inherit from this class. The below example shows how label text is set on a button using properties. This can be made much simpler by setting this label directly in the init of C<Gnome::Gtk3::Button>. The purpose of this example, however, is that there might be other properties which can only be set this way.

  use Gnome::GObject::Object;
  use Gnome::GObject::Value;
  use Gnome::GObject::Type;
  use Gnome::Gtk3::Button;

  my Gnome::GObject::Value $gv .= new(:init(G_TYPE_STRING));

  my Gnome::Gtk3::Button $b .= new(:empty);
  $gv.g-value-set-string('Open file');
  $b.g-object-set-property( 'label', $gv);

=head3 multi method new ( :$widget! )

Create a Perl6 widget object using a native widget from elsewhere. $widget can be a N-GOBject or a Perl6 widget like C< Gnome::Gtk3::Button>.

  # Some set of radio buttons grouped together
  my Gnome::Gtk3::RadioButton $rb1 .= new(:label('Download everything'));
  my Gnome::Gtk3::RadioButton $rb2 .= new(
    :group-from($rb1), :label('Download core only')
  );

  # Get all radio buttons in the group of button $rb2
  my Gnome::GObject::SList $rb-list .= new(:gslist($rb2.get-group));
  loop ( Int $i = 0; $i < $rb-list.g_slist_length; $i++ ) {
    # Get button from the list
    my Gnome::Gtk3::RadioButton $rb .= new(
      :widget($rb-list.nth-data-gobject($i))
    );

    # If radio button is selected (=active) ...
    if $rb.get-active == 1 {
      ...

      last;
    }
  }

Another example is a difficult way to get a button.

  my Gnome::Gtk3::Button $start-button .= new(
    :widget(Gnome::Gtk3::Button.gtk_button_new_with_label('Start'))
  );

=head3 multi method new ( Str :$build-id! )

Create a Perl6 widget object using a C<Gnome::Gtk3::Builder>. The builder class will return its corresponding object address and it will be stored in the C<Gnome::GObject::Object>. It can then be used to search for id's defined in the GUI glade design.

  my Gnome::Gtk3::Builder $builder .= new(:filename<my-gui.glade>);
  my Gnome::Gtk3::Button $button .= new(:build-id<my-gui-button>);

Create a C<Gnome::GObject:Object> object. Rarely used directly.

Register a handler to process a signal or an event. There are several types of callbacks which can be handled by this regstration. They can be controlled by using a named argument with a special name.

handlers are;

    object: :$widget, :handle-arg0($event),

  )
  handler (

Other forms are explained in the widget documentations when signals are provided.
=end item


=begin item

=end item

=begin item

provided to the user handler when an event for the handler is fired. There
will always be one named argument C<:$widget> which holds the class object
on which the signal was registered. The name 'widget' is therefore reserved.
An other reserved named argument is of course C<:$event>.

  method g_object_get_property (

Gets a property of an object. value must have been initialized to the expected type of the property (or a type to which the expected type can be transformed) using g_value_init().

In general, a copy is made of the property contents and the caller is responsible for freeing the memory by calling g_value_unset().

=item $property_name; the name of the property to get.
=item $value; return location for the property value.

=head2 g_object_notify

  method g_object_notify ( Str $property_name )

Emits a C<notify> signal for the property C<property_name> on object .

When possible, e.g. when signaling a property change from within the class that registered the property, you should use C<g_object_notify_by_pspec()>(not supported yet) instead.

Note that emission of the notify signal may be blocked with C<g_object_freeze_notify()>. In this case, the signal emissions are queued and will be emitted (in reverse order) when C<g_object_thaw_notify()> is called.

=item $property_name; the name of a property installed on the class of object.

=begin pod
=head2 [g_object_] freeze_notify

  method g_object_freeze_notify ( )

Increases the freeze count on object . If the freeze count is non-zero, the emission of C<notify> signals on object is stopped. The signals are queued until the freeze count is decreased to zero. Duplicate notifications are squashed so that at most one C<notify> signal is emitted for each property modified while the object is frozen.

This is necessary for accessors that modify multiple properties to prevent premature notification while the object is still being modified.

=begin pod
=head2 [g_object_] thaw_notify

  method g_object_thaw_notify ( )

Reverts the effect of a previous call to C<g_object_freeze_notify()>. The freeze count is decreased on object and when it reaches zero, queued C<notify> signals are emitted.

Duplicate notifications for each property are squashed so that at most one C<notify> signal is emitted for each property, in the reverse order in which they have been queued.

It is an error to call this function when the freeze count is zero.

=head2 Not yet supported signals
=head3 notify

The notify signal is emitted on an object when one of its properties has its value set through g_object_set_property(), g_object_set(), et al.

Note that getting this signal doesnâ€™t itself guarantee that the value of the property has actually changed. When it is emitted is determined by the derived GObject class. If the implementor did not create the property with C<G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY>, then any call to g_object_set_property() results in C<notify> being emitted, even if the new value is the same as the old. If they did pass C<G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY>, then this signal is emitted only when they explicitly call C<g_object_notify()> or C<g_object_notify_by_pspec()>, and common practice is to do that only when the value has actually changed.

This signal is typically used to obtain change notification for a single property, by specifying the property name as a detail in the C<g_signal_connect()> call, like this:

Signal C<notify> is not yet supported.
